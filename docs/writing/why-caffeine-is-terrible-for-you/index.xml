    <description>Caffeine is so bad for you that your body has to spread it out to every region including your brain so that you donâ€™t die while your liver slowly detoxes it. It then blocks your adenosine receptors causing uncontrolled neuron firing in your brain. This causes an emergency mode in your body which triggers the pituitary gland to release ACTH.&#xA;ACTH tells your adrenals to pump out stress hormones by more than 200% (which is why your feel alert). This increases your heart rate and your blood pressure, restricts bloodflow to your brain, dampens digestive processes causing putrification in your gut, releases sugar into your bloodstream, disrupts the metabolism of GABA, decreases the absorption of thiamin, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, and some B vitamins.</description>

    <description>An elite assasin from far away started to disagree with the ethics of his guild. If he leaves the guild they will kill him, so he stows away in a coffin to a new kingdom, where he tries to find a group that is virtuous, in staging a coup to help someone take over power, he finds that the new power is not as good as they seemed, and he end up rescuing a princess in the middle of the chaos. While trying to stay virtuous on their adventure, she sedates him with tea often and rapes him in his sleep. This saps him of his powers and he slowly loses his skills as an assassin, and begins to cave into temptation.</description>

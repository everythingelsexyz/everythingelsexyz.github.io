When your brain detects caffeine, it signals your body to release ACTH. This signals your adrenal glands to produce stress hormones. This is the beginning of a stress response that effects every area of our body. As you will see, the cumulative effects of chronic caffeine use can lead to serious damage.

When you go into the stress response, or fight-or-flight mode, blood flow in the brain is transferred from the higher centers of your brain (the prefrontal cortex) to the "lower" brain (the amygdala).

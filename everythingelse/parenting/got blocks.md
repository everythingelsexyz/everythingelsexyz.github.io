We be playing Minecraft

Got a lot of buildings

In and out of servers

Some would say we’re chilling

  
  

Who’s that on my server?

Jesse, yea I heard her

Rotten flesh not murder

Witherstorm’s not a flirter

  
  

I mine diamonds don’t drink from a tea cup

I find villages abandoned you and me bruh

I trade emeralds for piggy not named me yuh

A fine line but we still not callin peta

  
  

Eat um up drink em up bake um up shake em

Make a creeper drop into a cave and then I fake em

Make me start all over and I’ll eat you with the bacon

Go into my chest you better not I’ll leave you quakin

  
  

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Dig straight down and I’ll melt my socks

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Wear diamond armor and I’ve got a pet fox

  
  

Think back to the day when I only had a fist

Thought of so much things to build from my list

Got a pick axe so I’ll mine anything that I wish

Then petra gonna help me build a rod for my fish

Mine so deep that I run into a cave though

Mine no sweep we be flying with no cape though

Elytra wings we be rising to the end zone

Game so sweet we be playing on our cell phones

  
  

Snack? Cheetos

After that? Burrito

Wack? That’s me though

I’m back? Free throw

I’ve got a lot of blocks never watched the red socks

If you wanna play a game you better meet me round the block

  
  

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Dig straight down and I’ll melt my socks

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Wear diamond armor and I’ve got a pet fox

  
  

Don’t stop till I drop to the void and get destroyed

I build so much that it will leave me unemployed

Take a pic snap it then I’ll post a polaroid

Take a nap at night these zombies got me paranoid

  
  

Red stone? Gotta listen on your headphones

Dead bone? You better hope there aren’t clones

Cobblestone? We’re gonna use it as your head stone

Noobs just arrived now let’s go watch them get pwned

  
  

Don’t eat me up Zombie slice you

Don’t beat me up ghast be nice dude

Don’t freeze me up like an ice cube

Don’t leave me up on this statue

  
  

Once upon a time I went to find some food

I ran into a trader who’s a real cool dude

He had a baby llama that was kind of cute

That spit up on my face man that was kind of rude

  
  

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Dig straight down and I’ll melt my socks

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Wear diamond armor and I’ve got a pet fox

  
  

Got bars of gold I found in a cave

These tiles are fold consider me swayed

Got cows in a pin don’t open the gate

If you come to my world you better behave

  
  

Fantatic wrap it and ship it in plastic

TNT Blast it dig it like magic

Keepin me stacking actin rappin

Right out the basket build it the fastest

  
  

It’s night time callin for a lifeline

Send down the pipeline then I might grind

my world is for a lifetime nice slimes

my world is full of mobs and I might cry

  
  

Blaze angry shooting fireballs

Cave spiders climbing up the walls

Plenty Torches spread out in my halls

A noob just found out he can climb waterfalls

  
  

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Dig straight down and I’ll melt my socks

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Wear diamond armor and I’ve got a pet fox

  
  

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Dig straight down and I’ll melt my socks

Got blocks, gotta lot of blocks

Wear diamond armor and I’ve got a pet fox

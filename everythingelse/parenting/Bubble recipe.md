Bubble machine bubbles

  

My method is this

- Fairy washing up liquid
    
- [Guar gum powder](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Guar+gum+powder+bubbles&cId=f9241dc9-3451-4117-9c6d-a04f0e8ef40e&iId=a729874e-9194-49c7-ae16-7448b0c81936)
    
- Bicarbonate of Soda
    
- Glycerin
    
- Water
    

One litre of warm water, 3 tbsp fairy, 1tsp guar, 1 tsp bicarb, 2 tsp glycerin

Mix the guar gum with the glycerin by adding small amounts of glycerin and stirring (as if you were making a cornstarch thickener for a stew). Then add the bicarb. This can all be added to the water and soap mix

Some people say baking powder instead of bicarb and I'm not entirely sure why the acidity in baking powder helps. Could be worth a try.

This is good for making giant >1m bubbles
